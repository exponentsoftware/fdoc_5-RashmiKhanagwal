2. Explain the following questions in your own words

ques 1. -- What is the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce ? Explain these using your own words
answer -- 

> forEach -- 

ques 2. -- Explain the difference between function declaration and arrow function ?
answer -- 

> function declaration -- 
 - A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. 
    The function declaration must have a function name.
 - Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they 
    cannot be nested inside a functional block.
 - These are executed before any other code.
 - The function in function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.

> arrow function -- 



ques 3. -- Explain the difference between find and findIndex ?
answer --  

> find() --  the method find() is used to return the first array element that passes a certain test function.
The find method takes a function as its parameter and the function itself takes three arguments: 
the element, the index, and the array itself.

> findIndex() -- The method findIndex is used to return the index of the first array element that 
passes a certain test function.
The method findIndex also takes a callback function which can take three parameters(element, index, and array).

Inshort, the find() method returns the value of the element whereas the findIndex() method returns the index of 
the element.


ques 4. -- If you like to filter out one object element in an array which method do you like to use: filter or find ? 
Explain

answer -- I would like to use find() method as it returns the values of the child elements only. While filter() method
filters of all the elements values.   

ques 5. -- Explain the difference of var, let and const when we declare a variable ?
answer -- 

var - The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function 
    can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. 

let - The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular block ({block}).

const -  The scope of a const variable is only block scoped. The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.
